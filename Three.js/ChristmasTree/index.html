      <h2>Camping Pillow üéÅ</h2>
        <img src="images/pillow.jpg" alt="pillow" width="200" height="150">
          <p>I got you this camping pillow because we like to go camping and I feel like our pillows take up a lot of room 
            when we travel. This is much smaller and hopefully just as comfy. You also love to fall asleep when we are driving,
            and I think this would be good to use for sleeping in the car. I hope you enjoy it! Hopefully we can use it soon.

        <p>I got you this soup recipe book because I know you love making soups. They are always very tasty and since you keep
         making new ones, this recipe book should give you lots of good ideas for more soups. I am excited to try some of them!
